# mini-app-assignment
This is a mini app with a countdown timer and image uploader.
Built with React and hooks, this is a small app and not yet all the functions I intented to make work.
You can: 
-Start a timer that count down from 5
-Pause and resume the timer
-Reset the timer
-Upload a image and it will be dislayed on the page with its name and the time of uploading it

You can not yet input time on the countdown timer and the upload image button does nothing.
